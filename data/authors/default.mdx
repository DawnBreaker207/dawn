## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving-hand" /> I'm Tung Anh (Aka Dawn **I'm not sure about my foreign name, maybe can change**)

I have a passion for **Java** , **JavaScript/Typescript** and web development.
I'm currently start a journey as a fullstack developer.
I work mainly with **Java**, **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **Angular**, and **Spring**.

## Why have this blog?

> My desire to practice my skills and share my acquired knowledge fuels my endeavors.

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a software engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow web developers.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.

## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.com) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

This blog site takes inspiration from karhdo.dev. I appreciate [Khanh Do](https://twitter.com/karhdo) and [Timothy Lin](https://twitter.com/timlrxx) for their contribution to this minimal, lightweight, and highly customizable blog starter.

A few major over-engineering-changes from the original repo:

- <Twemoji className="!mr-2" emoji="atom-symbol" /> Upgrading to **React 19**, **Next 15**,
  **Tailwind 4**..

- <Twemoji className="!mr-2" emoji="party-popper" /> Adopting **Typescript**, committing with
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and integrate
  [Notion](https://www.notion.com) for CMS blog.

- <Twemoji className="!mr-2" emoji="bar-chart" /> Monitoring site with [Umami](https://umami.is/)
  website analytics

- <Twemoji className="!mr-2" emoji="eyes" /> Theming in dark mode with [Tokyonight Neovim
  Theme](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) colors for better contrast.

- <Twemoji className="!mr-2" emoji="man-technologist" /> My website refers to the design and code
  from the [karhdo.dev](https://github.com/Karhdo/karhdo.dev) repository and incorporates the
  tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog template, version 2.4.

- <Twemoji className="!mr-2" emoji="inbox-tray" /> Bumping up `mdx-bundler`, `rehype`/`remark`
  plugins and dependencies to the latest version
