When you first times learn back-end, you just learn basic Java concept, create a simple menu with console UI . But it waste a lot of your time, you want to build a complex and scalable systems with a lots of tools like K8s, Spring Cloud, Microservices… When you have hype adrenaline, you start thinking how to design databases, architecture of systems, tech you will use like Spring, Eureka, API gateway… 1st times, you search how to folder structure microservice, create a repo on Github and name’s it E-commerce. Trying to understand a lot of concept around microservice like API-gateway,


how service connect together…. You think after read and watch some tutorial on youtube and clone them, you can modifier as your thought. 2nd times, you modifier a lot of codebase, you feel indefinite with some concept. And after times and after times, your code base like a spaghetti code. And you ask why it’s so complicated, I read and write with tutorial is simple, with modifier them so difficult.


# 1. The basics


To understand all the tools and tech, you must understand the fundamental of programming. But you skip that, and learn how to use the tools to create a project faster and create difficult features.
