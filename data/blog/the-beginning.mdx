# Hello, and Welcome to My Very First Blog Post! 👋


In this post, I’d like to share **why I started this blog**, **how I built it**, and a bit about **the development process behind it**.


I hope you enjoy reading.


## 1. Why — The Idea Behind the Project 💡


Back in school, I spent a lot of time reading blogs to understand the perspectives of different authors. One day, when my lecturer introduced himself, he showed his personal portfolio website — and that moment really inspired me to create my own blog.


Most Vietnamese tech writers I follow usually share their thoughts about technology and programming fundamentals from their own experience. This blog will be similar, but with a more **personal touch** — I’ll also share my **life experiences**, **school journey**, and other things I’ve learned along the way.


## 2. How — Building the Website ⚙️


This isn’t the first version I tried to make. At first, I attempted to build it **from scratch using React**, but it turned out to be **too time-consuming** and **inefficient**. I eventually gave up and looked for another solution.


Finally, I discovered [this template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), which became the foundation of my current blog. You can use the template as-is, but in my opinion, the **default design** wasn’t very appealing. So, I looked through other projects built on top of it for **inspiration**, and customized mine based on what I liked.


To manage the content, I integrated **Notion** — basically turning it into a lightweight CMS (Content Management System). If you want to learn how to connect Notion with your website, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-qtkYM4ZM)


Once your blog is ready, you don’t need to buy hosting — you can deploy it **for free** on **Vercel**. Here’s [a guide](https://vercel.com/docs/git) for deploying from a GitHub repo.


## 3. Conclusion ✨


And that’s it for my very first post! I just wanted to share a bit about **why** and **how** this blog came to life.


Thank you so much for stopping by — I hope you’ll enjoy reading what comes next. 🙏
