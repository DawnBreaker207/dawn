# Hello, and Welcome to My Very First Blog Post! 👋


In this post, I’d like to share **why I started this blog**, **how I built it**, and a bit about **the development process behind it**. I hope you enjoy reading.


## 1. Why — The Idea Behind the Project 💡


Back in school, I spent a lot of time reading blogs or posts to understand the perspectives of different authors. One day, when my lecturer showed his personal portfolio website to introduce himself— and that moment really inspired me to create my own — a portfolio that also serves as a blog where I can share my thoughts and experiences.


Most tech writers I follow usually share their thoughts about technology and programming fundamentals from their own experience. This blog will be similar, but with a more **personal touch** — I’ll also share my **life experiences**, **school journey**, and other things I’ve learned along the way.


## 2. How — Building the Website ⚙️


This isn’t the first version I tried to create. At first, I attempted to build it **from scratch using React**, but it turned out to be **too time-consuming** and **inefficient**. I eventually gave up and looked for another solution.


Finally, I discovered [this template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), which became the foundation of my blog. You can use the template as-is, but in my opinion, the **default design** wasn’t very appealing. So, I looked through other variants of the template for **inspiration**, and customized mine based on what I liked.


To manage the blog content, I integrated **Notion** — basically turning it into a lightweight CMS (Content Management System). I connected Notion to my website so that the page can automatically fetch and render the content in a format the template understands. If you want to learn how to connect Notion with your website, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-qtkYM4ZM). Or if you’d like to know how to fetch and render data from Notion, feel free to check out [my project.](https://github.com/DawnBreaker207/dawn)


Once this blog is ready, I don’t need to buy hosting — just deploy it on **Vercel** **for free.**  Here’s [a guide](https://vercel.com/docs/git) for deploying from a GitHub repo.


## 3. Conclusion ✨


And that’s it for my very first post! I just wanted to share a bit about **why** and **how** this blog came to life.


Thank you so much for stopping by — I hope you’ll enjoy reading what comes next. 🙏
