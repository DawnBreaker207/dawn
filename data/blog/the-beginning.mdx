Hello, and welcome to my very first blog post! In this post, I’d like to share why I started this blog, how I built it, and a bit about the development process behind it. I hope you enjoy reading.


# 1. Why? The idea behind the project


Back in school, I spent a lot of time reading blogs to understand the perspective of the authors. When my lecturer introduced himself, he showed his portfolio page—and that inspired me to create my own blog.


Most Vietnamese authors I read write about tech topics and the fundamentals of technology from their own understanding. This blog is similar, but with a personal touch: I’ll also share my life experiences, my school journey, and more.


## 2. How? Building the website


This isn’t the first version I tried to make. At first, I attempted to build it from scratch using React, but it was time-consuming and inefficient. I eventually gave up and looked for another solution. Finally, I found [this template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)


You can use the template as-is, but in my opinion, the default design isn’t very appealing. I looked at other projects built with this template for inspiration. I also integrated Notion to manage my blog content—think of Notion as a simple CMS.


 If you want to learn how to connect Notion with your web page, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9-qtkYM4ZM). Once your blog is ready, you don’t need to buy hosting—you can deploy it on Vercel. Here’s [a guide](https://vercel.com/docs/git) for deploying with a Github repo.


## 3. Conclusion


And that’s it for my first post! I hope you enjoy browsing my site. Thanks so much for stopping by and reading.
