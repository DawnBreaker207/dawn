Every task we code comes with its own risks. This is a story about that process


## 🖥️ The moment of panic


When I finished a task assigned and ran the app to test, the console spat out a stack trace.


Instantly, my mind raced: _“What went wrong? Did something wrong ?”_


It’s a feeling every developer knows — a mix of emotion: panic, and despair. You read the stack trace, try to understand it.


I started tracing the error line by line, imagining the flow of my code. I realized that a control statement was wrong and I though:


“Ahah! Found it — now it should work!”


But after fixing it and running again… it still failed. Hours passed. Stress mounted. Frustration grew. It felt like find a needle in a haystack. And suddenly, the culprit appeared — a **semicolon (;)** missing.


I laughed at myself: “How could I miss that?”


It was a tiny mistake, but it left a huge impression. That small semicolon can easily derail everything — and how patience requires to debugging .


## 🔍 Learn from the experience


Fixing this bug taught me more than hours of reading or watching tutorials ever could.


I realized that learning had always been a combination of methods:

- **Books:**  Explain concepts, rules, and how it work. They are great for understanding “what”, “why” and “how”. But need to practice to really understand the concept.
- **Tutorials:** Show practical examples and guided steps. They are useful in practice , but can create “tutorial hell” — the follow step by step without truly thinking.
- **Practice:** Writing code, breaking it, debugging — this is messy, frustrating, and slow, but it’s the only way to reorganize knowledge and understand how things work in reality.

This experience made me realize that **true learning happens when struggle**. It’s when you wrestle with problems on your own that concepts finally stick.


## 💡 The Lessons Learned


Failure is part of life — don’t fear it. Every new project or problem will bring mistakes. What matters is having the **courage to face failure**, reflect on it, and **draw your own conclusions**.


Even if the result isn’t perfect, each bug you fix is a **lesson learned**. Some failures leave you frustrated, but they make you stronger for the next challenge.


And that’s the journey of the code, the bug, and the error — each one a lesson, a step forward, and a reminder that learning comes from **getting your hands dirty** and **facing problems directly**.


Moments like this bug forced me to **face the uncomfortable**, revealing gaps in my understanding. It showed me that **mastery comes from doing, failing, reflecting, and repeating**.


The cycle code → bug → error  is more than just debugging. It’s a mirror for how we learn, adapt, and grow.
