After setting up the layers, I wanted to see what happened underneath.


How does data actually move between my app and the database.


So instead of relying on tools or abstractions, I decided to go **down to the metal â€”** to the JDBC level


## ðŸ’¾ Down to the JDBC Level


For education purposes I had to write almost everything myself, using only **Spring Boot** and **Spring Web**. I even wrote the **SQL** manually and took time to understand its syntax. 


Back in school, when I used **PHP**, I never really wrote SQL manually. I mostly used **phpMyAdmin** in **Xampp** to create tables or generate queries automatically. Later, most of my personal projects used **MongoDB** as the main database, so I got comfortable with **NoSQL**.


This was my first time actually using **SQL** in a real backend system. Iâ€™d learned the basics before â€”simple queries like **`SELECT`**, **`INSERT`** and **`UPDATE`** â€” but this was different. Now I had to design tables, define relationshipss, and make every thing work with the backend logic. It gave me a small sense of confident â€” like I was finally starting to get it.


## ðŸ”¨ Beginning from sctrach


I built the entire project without using tools like **Lombok** to speed things up. I already knew the concept of **ORM** (Object Relational Mapping) from theory, but I had never actually used it in practice. I wanted to fully understand the basics first before relying on any tools, so instead of using frameworks like **Spring JDBC, Sptring Data JDBC** or **Spring Data JPA,** I decided to go with the raw **JDBC API** to talk directly to the database â€”  just pure SQL â€” only a simple **`DataSource`** configuration from Spring to handle the connection. 


For everything else, I had to do it all by hand â€” basically reproducing SQL tools do behind the scenes. And oh boy! I had to write queries, open the connections, execute statements, and handle results through **`ResultSet`**. I even had to map every record manually. It was easy to understand how things worked, but the **boilerplate** was enormous â€” sometimes 20 to 30 lines of code just to run a single query it. Still, it was worth it. It took me days to complete the repository layer.


## ðŸš€ Ready for the Next Layer


That experience taught me more than any tutorial ever could. 


But the backend was only half the story. 


To make everything _visible_, I had to _see_ it â€” in action. 


Next stop: **the frontend**
