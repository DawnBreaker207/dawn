## 💭 A Few Words Before Diving In


First of all, I’m not saying microservices are bad. They’re great — but only when used in the right context. It all depends on the **size and complexity** of the system you’re trying to build. If you already know what you’re building and have experience in **system design**, then sure — microservices can be powerful. But if you’re just getting started, still learning the basics of your framework, then… **maybe not yet.**


Trust me on this one.


## 🧩 Why Microservices Exist


The main reason microservices were born is:

- **Separate logic** and make it easier for **multiple teams** to work on different parts of a large system at the same time.
- Each service is small and independent.
- It runs on its own, with its own data and boundaries.

That’s the beauty — and the pain — of microservices. Unlike a **monolith**, where everything sits in one place and calling other modules is easy, a **microservice architecture** forces you to think about communication, data consistency, and deployment separately. That’s a lot to handle if you’re new to software design.


And that’s exactly why many beginners feel **overwhelmed** when they start with microservices too early.


## 🚀 The Social Media Trap


Now you might say:

> “But everyone on social media is building microservices!”

Yeah, that’s true — but most of them already have years of experience building monolithic systems first. They didn’t start with microservices; they **grew into them**. There’s a difference between **following a trend** and **understanding the reason behind it.**


## 🧠 My Conclusion


What I’m really trying to say is this:

- If you’re a beginner, **don’t chase the buzzwords**.
- Start small.
- Learn the fundamentals.
- Build something with a monolith to understand how systems actually work.

Once you feel confident — when you can design, refactor, and understand trade-offs — that’s when **microservices** start to make sense. They’re not a magic solution; they’re just a tool. A powerful one, yes — but also a complex one. Because the truth is:

> The higher you climb before you’re ready, the harder you’ll fall.

So don’t just look at the greener grass on the other side. Take a good look at yourself. Know your strengths, know your limits, and grow from there. That’s all I wanted to share.


Thanks for reading. 👋
