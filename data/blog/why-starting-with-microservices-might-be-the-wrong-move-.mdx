## 💭 A Few Words Before Diving In


First of all, I’m not saying microservices are bad. They’re great — but only when used in the right context. It all depends on the **size and complexity** of the system you’re trying to build. If you already know what you’re building and have experience in **system design**, then sure — microservices can be powerful. But if you’re just getting started, still learning the basics of framework or language, then… **maybe not yet.**


Trust me on this one.


## 🧩 Why Microservices Existed


The main reason microservices were introduced is to:

- **Separate logic** and make it easier for **multiple teams** to work on different parts of a large system at the same time.

The advantages of using them are:

- Each service is small and independent.
- It runs on its own, with its own data and boundaries.

That’s the beauty — and the pain — of microservices. Unlike a **monolith**, where everything sits in one place and calling other modules is easy, a **microservice architecture** forces you to think about communication, data consistency, and deployment separately. That’s a lot to handle if you’re new to software design.


And that’s exactly why many beginners feel **overwhelmed** when they start with microservices too early.


## 🚀 The Social Media Trap


Now you might say:

> “But microservices are the trend now — everyone’s switching to them!”

Yeah, that’s true — microservices _are_ popular right now. But what most people don’t realize is that many of developers who build those systems already had years of experience building monolithic systems first. They didn’t start with microservices — no one does. 
You need to understand how a monolithic system works before you can break it apart, because microservices are basically just a collection of smaller monoliths connected together. There’s a big difference between **following a trend** and **understanding the architecture itself** — its purpose, its trade-offs, and the problems it was designed to solve.


## 🧠 Conclusion


What I’m really trying to say is this:

- If you’re a beginner, **don’t chase the buzzwords**.
- Start small.
- Learn the fundamentals.
- Build something with a monolith to understand how systems actually work.

Once you feel confident — when you can design, refactor, and understand trade-offs — that’s when **microservices** start to make sense. They’re not a magic solution; they’re just a tool. A powerful one, yes — but also a complex one. And if you try to use it before you’re ready, it’ll hurt more than it helps. 
Because the truth is:

> The higher you climb before you’re ready, the harder you’ll fall.

So don’t just look at the greener grass on the other side. Take a good look at yourself. Know your strengths, know your limits, and grow from there. 


That’s all I wanted to share. Thanks for reading. 👋
