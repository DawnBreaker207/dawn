## üí≠ Where It All Began


As I write this post, I‚Äôm still **unemployed**. I‚Äôve spent the past six months unemployed. During that time, I stepped out of my comfort zone and transition from **frontend to backend.** I spent that period learning **Java from scratch** and building a few small projects using **Spring** to gain hands-on experience. Once I felt ready, I started sending my CVs again, hoping to land an internship. 
But soon I realized something tough ‚Äî getting a job right now isn‚Äôt easy. I kept sending my CV everywhere, and most of the time‚Ä¶ no one replied. I started asking myself:

> ‚ÄúWhy am I failing? Why can‚Äôt I get a job?‚Äù

_CV I sent over half of year:_

## ü•Ä Facing Reality


It‚Äôs hard to accept the truth ‚Äî I **couldn‚Äôt find a job**.


I had to face the worst-case scenario and come up with a **backup plan**. My choice? Continue my studies at university after graduating from college. I accepted the truth ‚Äî that maybe I‚Äôm **not good enough yet** for recruiters to notice. And that‚Äôs okay. At that time in university, I had **two options**:

1. Keep sending CVs in the hope for an offer.
2. Keep studying, learning, and improving my skills.

With advice from my mentor, I realized that option 1 would only drain my time and motivation. So I chose **option 2** ‚Äî and I‚Äôm still learning and growing along the way. You might be thinking:

> ‚ÄúWhy am I reading a post from some stranger complaining about their life?‚Äù

Fair question üòÖ


But everything I‚Äôve shared so far explains **why I started this page**, and **why I began building my side project ‚Äî** to grow, to learn, and to share my journey along the way. English isn‚Äôt my first language, so apologies for any awkward phrasing. I‚Äôm doing my best. üôè


## ‚öôÔ∏è Choosing What to Build


With all this free time, I had a choice: waste it doing nothing, or **do something meaningful**. I wanted to challenge myself and step out of my comfort zone. The question was:

> ‚ÄúWhat kind of system should I build?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want another **basic calculator** or **tic-tac-toe** app. I wanted something closer to a **real-world system**. After researching and comparing ideas, I decided to build a **ticket reservation system**


## üéüÔ∏è Why Ticket Booking?


You might ask,

> ‚ÄúWhy not an e-commerce system?‚Äù

I‚Äôve actually built e-commerce projects many times during college, so the topic had become quite repetitive and a bit tiresome. Repeating the same theme again didn‚Äôt feel exciting. On top of that, by ‚Äúe-commerce‚Äù here, I mean **real-world platforms** like Shopee ‚Äî with complex workflows, multiple teams, and tons of business logic. Simulating a system like that on my own would be extremely challenging, and given my current skill level, I simply didn‚Äôt have the capacity to implement it properly.

A ticket booking system, on the other hand, felt **balanced** ‚Äî not too simple, not too complicated. The core booking flow is straightforward, but implementing it realistically requires integrating multiple technologies ‚Äî that‚Äôs where the challenge lies.



After analyzing several examples, I found [**Beta Cinemas**](https://betacinemas.vn/home.htm) as a great reference. And to populate movie data, I used [**TMDB**](https://www.themoviedb.org/) **-** an amazing resource for movie metadata. From there, I started designing my first **database version (v1)**. Here‚Äôs what it looked like üëá


```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `user` (
	id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	surname VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS movie (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
	poster VARCHAR(255),
	overview TEXT,
	duration INT NOT NULL,
	genre VARCHAR(100),
	release_date DATE,
	imdb_id VARCHAR(255),
	film_id VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cinema_hall (
	id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	movie_id INT NOT NULL,
	movie_session DATETIME NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT fk_hall_movie FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movie(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS seat (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    cinema_hall_id INT NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
    seat_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('AVAILABLE', 'BOOKED') DEFAULT 'AVAILABLE',
    CONSTRAINT fk_seat_hall FOREIGN KEY (cinema_hall_id) REFERENCES cinema_hall(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE (cinema_hall_id, seat_number)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
	id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
	user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
	cinema_hall_id INT NOT NULL,
	status ENUM('CREATED','CONFIRMED','CANCELLED') DEFAULT 'CREATED', 
	payment_method ENUM ('MOMO', 'VNPAY', 'ZALOPAY', 'CASH') DEFAULT 'CASH',
	payment_status ENUM('PENDING', 'PAID', 'CANCELLED') DEFAULT 'PENDING',
	total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
	order_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	expired_at DATETIME,
	CONSTRAINT fk_order_user FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	CONSTRAINT fk_order_hall FOREIGN KEY (cinema_hall_id) REFERENCES cinema_hall(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS order_seat(
	id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
	order_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	seat_id INT NOT NULL,
	price DECIMAL (10, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00,
	CONSTRAINT fk_order_seat_order FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
	CONSTRAINT fk_order_seat FOREIGN KEY (seat_id) REFERENCES seat(id) ON DELETE CASCADE	
);
```


## üß© My Background


As you can see ‚Äî yeah, it‚Äôs not perfect. It‚Äôs full of duplication and probably not following normalization rules at all. üòÖ But this is a **study project**, so mistakes are part of the process. Coming from a **frontend background**, I had almost **zero experience with SQL**.


Before diving into Java, I mainly worked with the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** ‚Äî my core language was **JavaScript**, and I built most of my projects with **React** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend.


Later, I switched to **Angular** and started learning **Java** to explore backend development more seriously. So yeah, I didn‚Äôt know what **DDL**, **DML**, or **1NF/2NF/3NF** were. Not even one of them. I‚Äôm improving this skill every day ‚Äî it‚Äôs both a strength and a crucial part of backend development.


## üîß Tech Stack and What‚Äôs Next


After defining the idea, system flow, and database, I decided on my stack: **Angular + Spring Boot + MySQL.** And with that, I finally started building my full-stack system. What happens next? You‚Äôll have to wait for the next post. üòâ Thanks for reading all the way here ‚Äî I really appreciate it. This post isn‚Äôt just about code ‚Äî it‚Äôs about **growth**, **failure**, and **persistence**.


See you in the next one. üëã
